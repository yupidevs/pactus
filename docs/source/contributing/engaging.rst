Increasing Visibility and Engagement
====================================

Do you want to help with the development of pactus? We have some ideas on how to do it:


Bug reporting
-------------

Your script isn't working, and you are sure the issue lies with pactus? Make sure 
you are using the latest available pypi package and if the problem persists, 
open an issue in `GitHub <https://github.com/yupidevs/pactus/issues>`_ to let us know.


Requesting new features
-----------------------

You can similarly use the issues in `GitHub <https://github.com/yupidevs/pactus/issues>`_ to
suggest new features you want to see in new releases of pactus.


Extending pactus source code
----------------------------

If you want to contribute directly to the project (improve documentation, implement new 
features or fix existing bugs) you can make a pull request and we will analyze it as soon as 
possible. Moreover, we have dedicated guidelines for contributions focused on adding datasets,
models or featurizers. You can find them right after this page.


Adding new examples of usage
----------------------------

Even without contributing to the pactus source code, if you use pactus for your research, you 
can request the addition of your scripts to the examples hosted in the documentation. We will
evaluate the proposal according to the quality of the results and the differences among already
existing examples.

Increasing pactus visibility
