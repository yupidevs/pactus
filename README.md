# pactus

Standing from *Path Classification Tools for Unifying Strategies*, **pactus**
is a Python library that allows testing different classification methods on
several trajectory datasets.

It comes with some built-in models and datasets according to the
state-of-the-art in trajectory classification. However, it is implemented in an
extensible way, so the users can build their own models and datasets.

> NOTE: Built-in datasets don't contain the raw trajectoy data. When a
> dataset is loaded for the first time it downloads the necessary data
> automatically.

## Installation

Make sure you have a Python interpreter newer than version 3.8:

```bash
‚ùØ python --version
Python 3.8.0
```

Then, you can simply install pactus from pypi using pip:

```bash
pip install pactus
```

## Getting started

This is quick example of how to test a Random Forest classifier on the Animals dataset:

```python
from pactus import Dataset, featurizers
from pactus.models import RandomForestModel

# Load dataset
dataset = Dataset.animals()

# Split data into train and test subsets
train, test = dataset.split(0.9)

# Convert trajectories into feature vectors
ft = featurizers.UniversalFeaturizer()

# Build and train the model
model = RandomForestModel(featurizer=ft)
model.train(train, cross_validation=5)

# Evaluate the results on the test subset
evaluation = model.evaluate(test)
evaluation.show()
```

It should output evaluation results similar to:

```text
General statistics:

Accuracy: 0.962
F1-score: 0.951
Mean precision: 0.976
Mean recall: 0.933

Confusion matrix:
